# Podaj Łapę
Podaj Łapę is a web application designed for both adopting dogs from the dog shelters and putting them into ones if we decide we won't menage to be the owners. Users can filter the dogs in the nearest area and choose their own preferences such as age or breed. While searching through the shelters they can get information about the conditions in each shelter and about room accessibility for their pet.
